                <p>
                    My name is Hannah Young and I am currently a senior at Cal Poly SLO, majoring
                    in Business Administration, with a concentration in marketing and a minor in
                    statistics. I have moved 25 times in my 22 years of life, which has given me
                    the opportunity to learn communication skills across different cultures, along
                    with the ability to adapt. Throughout my late high school and college years I
                    have interned in many different business roles. First, I worked for an
                    accounting company doing search engine optimization and running google ads-
                    ultimately doubling website traffic. I worked for a startup called Terrain
                    Data next, where I ran an email marketing campaign and learned the “tech”
                    language. Furthering my marketing experience, I worked for another startup
                    City and Shiplap, where I ran point on social media- this included creating ad
                    campaigns and data analysis and visualization which ultimately led to a 23k
                    follower growth in just under a year. Finally, I interned for Amazon, where
                    I worked with large datasets, wrote SQL queries and used advance excel to
                    solve one of their business problems, leading to a solution that would save
                    them $100 million per year.
