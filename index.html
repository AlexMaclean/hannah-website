        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Hannah Young and I am currently a senior at Cal Poly SLO,
          majoring in Business Administration, with a concentration in marketing
          and a minor in statistics. I have moved 25 times in my 22 years of
          life, which has given me the opportunity to learn communication skills
          across different cultures, along with the ability to adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my late high school and college years I have interned in
          many different business roles. First, I worked for an accounting
          company doing search engine optimization and running google ads-
          ultimately doubling website traffic. I worked for a startup called
          Terrain Data next, where I ran an email marketing campaign and learned
          the “tech” language. Furthering my marketing experience, I worked for
          another startup City and Shiplap, where I ran point on social media-
          this included creating ad campaigns and data analysis and
          visualization which ultimately led to a 23k follower growth in just
          under a year. Finally, I interned for Amazon, where I worked with
          large datasets, wrote SQL queries and used advance excel to solve one
          of their business problems, leading to a solution that would save them
          $100 million per year.
