        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a student at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where I am majoring in Computer Science.
            I was born and grew up in Seattle, Washington, where I attended Roosevelt High School and earned Eagle Scout in Troop 186.
            My interests include swimming, climbing, and software development.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
            I interned virtually for Dropbox in the summers of 2021 and 2020 on the team success and photos teams.
            Previous to that, I interned at Rosepoint Navigation Systems in 2019.
            In high school, I interned for Math Adventure, Microsoft, and The MacCoss Lab.
