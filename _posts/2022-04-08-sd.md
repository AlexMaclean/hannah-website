Hi from southern california!! Here is what I've done in the past 24 hours
at home:

- Did several beach walks with my mom and aunt.
- Tried out a new dinner spot in Ranch Sante Fe with incredible homemade 
  chips and guac and got to catch up with my uncle, cousin and grandma.
- Went on a bike ride along the coast...got a kit tan line :(
- Swam in the ocean! 
- Bought two $6 lattes at my favorite coffee shops...worth every penny!

It's pretty wild that this will be my last visit home from college.
I have no idea how far away I'll be next year. 

Hopefully not too far, I think I've realized the sunshine is very important 
in regards to my sanity ;)
