Wow, the past week has been wild.

- Finally got my check engine light inspected, only to be told my car
needed $500 worth of new spark plugs...
- My boyfriend's house got broken into while we were asleep and 8 bikes
along with a camera, safe and computer were stolen.
- Got rejected from a job I thought I nailed the interview for (rejection sucks).

Safe to say that the new season has brought about a lot of changes. All I know
is that everything that happens is leading me in the direction I am supposed to go...

And in this case, it seems to be homeless slums searching for the missing bikes.
