## About Me

My name is Hannah Young and I am currently a financial analyst at Amazon, after graduating from Cal Poly with
a major in Business Administration and a minor in statistics. I have moved 25 times in my 22 years of
life, which has given me the opportunity to learn communication skills
across different cultures, along with the ability to adapt. I am 
passionate about data analytics and product management. In my free time, I love to walk, cycle,
practice yoga, and backpack.

Throughout high school and college I have interned in
many different business roles. First, I worked for an accounting
company doing search engine optimization and running google ads-
ultimately doubling website traffic. I worked for a startup called
Terrain Data next, where I ran an email marketing campaign.
Furthering my marketing experience, I worked for
another startup City and Shiplap, where I ran point on social media-
this included runnning ad campaigns and data analysis/
visualization which ultimately led to a 23k follower growth in just
under a year. Finally, I interned for Amazon, where I worked with
large datasets, wrote SQL queries and used advance excel to solve one
of their business problems, leading to a solution that would save them
$100 million per year.
